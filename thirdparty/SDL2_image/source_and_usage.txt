Put in Debug and Release folders

Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer window of Visual Studio and select "Properties" from the context menu.

In the Project Properties window, go to the "Build Events" tab.
xcopy "$(SolutionDir)\thirdparty\SDL_image\SDL2_image.dll"  "$(TargetDir)" /Y

In the "Post-build event command line" section, add a command to copy the SDL_image DLL file to the output directory. For example:

bash
Copy code
xcopy "$(SolutionDir)SDL_image\SDL2_image.dll" "$(TargetDir)" /Y
In this example, the SDL_image DLL file is located in the "SDL_image" folder under the solution directory. The "$(SolutionDir)" and "$(TargetDir)" variables are placeholders that Visual Studio will replace with the actual paths at build time.

Save the project properties and rebuild your project. The SDL_image DLL should now be copied to the output directory whenever you build your project.

Note that you may need to adjust the command line depending on the actual location of the SDL_image DLL file in your project directory structure. Also, make sure that the target directory (e.g. "Debug" or "Release") exists before you run the build.
