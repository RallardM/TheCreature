INTRO_SCENE:
           You awaken in complete darkness. You can barely see anything,          
              but you can feel the damp, cold stone floor beneath you.            
                 You don't know where you are or how you got here,                
         but you feel a sense of unease, as if something is not quite right.      
                                                                                  
MOVING_SCENE:
                                                                                  
       You try to move, but your body feels unfamiliar, as if it's not your own.  
              You can't remember your name, or anything about your past.          
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
KOBOLD_SCENE:
           As you try to piece together what might have happened to you,          
       a small, scrappy creature scurries up to you and begins spitting at you.   
 Its beady eyes reflect the dim light, you can tell that it's some sort of kobold.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
 NAME_SCENE:
                                                                                  
	                  "Me name it Kruj, and me be your guide.                     
                  Come... What me call you? Me show you way out."                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
ATTACK_SCENE:
                          You try to fight off the kobold,                        
                     but it's too dark and he's too fast for you.                 
          "No fight please! Friend! Me show you way out! What me call you?"       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
WEAPONS_SCENE:
                                                                                  
               Kruj: "There be weapons here. Take! Seeee? Kruj friend!"           
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
DEAD_END_SCENE:
                You reach a dead end. Iron bars block your path,                  
         you try to break them with all your might, but they won't budge.         
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
ENNEMY_SCENE:
                                                                                  
              You arrive at the end of the tunnel, but you see a large,           
      hulking figure standing before you. It's about to attack but you are faster:
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               You are unsure how to react to this sudden intrusion.
          You can try to communicate with the creature or fight it off.
                             The choice is yours.


You are completely alone, 
with no memory of who you are or what brought you here.

Will you try to find a way out of this dark tunnel and uncover the truth about your past? 
Or will you succumb to the darkness and become just another lost soul in this medieval world?
The choice is yours, adventurer.The fate of your story is in your hands.

                       As you contemplate your next move, 
         you realize that you find yourself in a dark and dangerous world.
                The stench of decay and sewage permeates the air,
           and you can hear the faint sounds of rats scurrying about.
